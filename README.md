# Module-2-VBA-CHALLENGE

Overview and purpose
1) Create VBA macros that can format read and change cell values
2) Learn how to use for loops and conditionals
3) learn how to format and other coding skills 
4) Use run buttons and timer, arrays, if-then conditional statements
5) The main purpose is to analyze code for Steve and refactor the module 2 solution code

# Results
## Comparing 2017 and 2018 Stock Analysis
2018 stock return was mostly negative wheras the 2017 return was positive and a much better investment. ENPH and RUN are good investments because they have positive returns in both 2017 and 2018 and they had very high increases exceeding over $200000000 the 2017 total volumes.

As it can be seen, the run times for the refactored code are a bit quicker than the original analysis code

# Summary
## Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
### Advantages
The main advantages of refactoring code is that the code is a bit more simplified and clean. Clean code is easier to update and improve. Another advantage is that it helps save time and is easier to understand. It is also easier to find errors and bugs in refactored code.

### Disadvantages
There are a few disadvantages of refactoring code. One of the main disadvantages is that it is very time consuming to complete the process especially if the coder is a beginner. Refactoring could also cost alot more money and add new bugs into the code. 

## How these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
One advantage was that reducing the number of loops decreases the memory needed for processing the data, which reduces the run time and optimizes the performance of the script. One disadvantage was that the code had to be tested with every new addition to make sure nothing went wrong and therefore it was very time consuming to complete.
